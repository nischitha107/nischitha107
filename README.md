👋 Hi, I’m Nischitha, a graduate student in Information Technology and Analytics with a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and applied research. I focus on building data-driven solutions that support decision-making, process optimization, and real-world problem solving.

🎓 Education
Master’s in Information Technology & Analytics, Rutgers Business School, Newark (Expected May 2026)
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science & Technology, SJB Institute of Technology

🛠️ Skills
Python, R, statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, SQL and NoSQL databases, cloud and big data tools, and analytics platforms including Tableau, Power BI, Plotly Dash, and Kepler.gl.

💼 Experience
Previously worked in an IoT and automation environment supporting system monitoring, data validation, and operational reporting within a manufacturing setup. Collaborated with IT, operations, and engineering teams to understand end-to-end workflows and contribute to performance tracking and process improvement initiatives.

📊 Projects
My projects span predictive modeling, deep learning, data visualization, and recommendation systems. They include air quality prediction using large-scale European environmental data, intrusion detection in IoT networks using deep learning, graph-based recommendation systems for e-commerce data, and urban mobility analysis using NYC taxi datasets. Each project emphasizes data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and actionable insights.
